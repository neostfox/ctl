# ctl Workflow Skills — Core Protocol

WORKFLOW_PROTOCOL_VERSION = 1

This is the platform-neutral workflow-skills core. It is split into an
**embedded** part (division of labor + invariants), carried verbatim inside
every workflow skill's managed-core block, and a **reference** part (phase map +
frameworks + provenance) that lives only in this file — the auto-loaded
control-guard carries the pipeline routing, and each skill's body covers its own
phase. The canonical copy lives at `.agent/protocols/workflow-skills.md`; a CI
drift check fails if any embedded copy diverges. Edit this file and re-sync
every workflow skill together — never one in isolation. Nothing platform-specific
(tool names, hook mechanics, plugin paths) and nothing phase-specific belongs in
the embedded part; that lives in each skill outside the managed core.

## Division of labor (non-negotiable)

Skills and agents manage **semantic workflow** — what to think about, in what
order, and which artifact each phase produces. ctl manages **facts, scope,
evidence, gates, ledgers, and honest disclosure**. A workflow skill never relaxes
a boundary, never declares a task complete, and never substitutes its own
judgement for ctl evidence. Workflow discipline is not proof: it does not replace
gates, audits, reviewer independence, or tamper evidence, and it never creates a
verdict.

## Invariants every phase honors

- Produce **artifacts, not claims**. "Done" is an evidence artifact ctl can see,
  never an assertion — "where is the evidence?"
- Keep **draft separate from confirmed basis**; disclose open uncertainty rather
  than hiding it.
- **Red before green**: no green claim without prior red evidence for the same
  behavior.
- **No fix before a reproduction loop.**
- **Architecture review is read-only**; a refactor needs a fresh governed task.
- External workflow inspiration is **L0 reference material** (see Provenance) —
  never an authority, never vendored as an active control.

<!-- ctl:workflow-core-reference:start -->
Reference material below — NOT embedded per skill. The auto-loaded control-guard
carries the pipeline; each skill's body covers its own phase. Kept here as the
single source of truth for the full map.

## Phase map

Phases run in this order; skip any whose preconditions are already met. Each
phase is a separate skill that carries this same embedded core plus its own body.

1. **grill / first principles** — before a PRD or implementation, when the
   request is ambiguous, too broad, high-risk, or likely to build the wrong
   thing. Output: alignment artifacts (observed facts, declared rules,
   assumptions, irreducible constraints, goals, non-goals, unknowns, a minimum
   viable experiment) — not a claim of truth.
2. **PRD** — after enough context is resolved and before generating multiple
   durable tasks. Draft until explicitly confirmed. Separate **ObservedBasis**
   (what the agent actually read) from **ConfirmedBasis** (what a user or project
   authority confirmed) from **OpenUncertainty** (unresolved unknowns, never
   hidden). Status is one of: draft · confirmed · superseded.
3. **tasks / issues** — vertical slices, each independently verifiable, each
   declaring objective, read scope, write scope, gates, acceptance evidence, and
   an **AFK / HITL** label and blocking uncertainties. Never bypass protected-path
   controls; never synthesize completed ctl events from a plan.
4. **TDD** — during implementation: one behavior at a time, red evidence before
   green evidence, refactor only after green. Test public behavior, not private
   implementation detail.
5. **diagnose / bayesian** — for bugs, flaky behavior, unexpected results, or
   architectural uncertainty. No fix before a red-capable feedback loop.
   Hypotheses must be falsifiable; prefer discriminating evidence over broad
   speculation.
6. **architecture review** — read-only by default; outputs candidates, not code
   changes. The user chooses which candidate becomes a new governed task.
7. **handoff** — when the session is long, context is high, when switching
   agents or platforms, or before AFK / starting a separate governed run.
8. **decision map** — situational, triggered from grill when an effort has
   **fog**: decisions that cannot resolve until frontier work advances. Maintains
   a project-level index (Destination · Frontier · Fog · Out of scope); fog
   graduates into tasks incrementally via `ctl-to-tasks` rather than one upfront
   slice pass. If grill surfaces no fog, skip it — the effort fits one session.

## Thinking frameworks, placed

- **First Principles** belongs in grill / design clarification: restate the
  problem, separate observed facts from declared rules from assumptions, name the
  irreducible constraints, and challenge inherited ones — "are we doing this
  because the domain requires it, or because the existing architecture/framework
  suggests it?" Outputs are artifacts, not verdicts.
- **Bayesian reasoning** belongs in diagnose / loop-breaking: rank falsifiable
  hypotheses, grade evidence, update belief in plain language, and seek the
  discriminating test. Ranked hypotheses and evidence quality — not numeric
  confidence scoring.

Do not create floating, generic "think better" skills; the frameworks live
inside the phases above.

## Provenance

These workflow skills are ctl-native rewrites inspired by Matt Pocock's
engineering skill workflow and by the First Principles / Bayesian placement
introduced in Trellis PR #335. External skill text is treated as L0 reference
material; ctl does not vendor third-party skills as an active control plane and
does not place them inside its trust boundary.
